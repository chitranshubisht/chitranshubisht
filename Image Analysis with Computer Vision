# Get the path to an image file

# Get a client for the computer vision service
computervision_client = ComputerVisionClient(cog_endpoint, CognitiveServicesCredentials(cog_key))

# Get a description from the computer vision service
image_stream = open(image_path, "rb")
description = computervision_client.describe_image_in_stream(image_stream)

vision.show_image_caption(image_path, description)
That seems reasonably accurate.

Let's try another image.

# Get the path to an image file
image_path = os.path.join('data', 'vision', 'store_cam2.jpg')

# Get a description from the computer vision service
image_stream = open(image_path, "rb")
description = computervision_client.describe_image_in_stream(image_stream)

# Display image and caption (code in helper_scripts/vision.py)
vision.show_image_caption(image_path, description)
